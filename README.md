Digital signatures, relying on user key pairs, authenticate and verify documents. Biometric technology, such as fingerprint recognition, is utilized for creating digital signatures. Fingerprint technology is prevalent in smartphones for unlocking. This combination of digital signatures, biometrics, and smartphone sensors innovatively enables fingerprint-based digital signing. When sending a document, the sender must scan their fingerprint on the smartphone's sensor, triggering encryption. The recipient then decrypts the message using the sender's public key. The fingerprint serves as a means to access the user's private key from a database. The RSA algorithm underpins the key pair system. This approach streamlines document authentication and security.
